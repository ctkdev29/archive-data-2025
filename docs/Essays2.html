  <h1>Exit and Collapse</h1>

  <section>
    <h2>Introduction</h2>
The global order is not fixed; it is a product of historical cycles and technological shifts that periodically upend the status quo. As the digital age accelerates change and erodes traditional institutions, the frameworks laid out in The Sovereign Individual and The Fourth Turning have become increasingly relevant—and, for many, prescient.

The Sovereign Individual, written by James Dale Davidson and William Rees-Mogg, anticipates the transformation of society as power moves away from centralized states and toward individuals empowered by information technology. It outlines a future where jurisdictional borders erode, economic autonomy increases, and the ability to exit oppressive systems becomes more viable than ever before. Its thesis is not utopian, but evolutionary: survival and success will favor those who adapt to a decentralized, networked reality.

In contrast—but not in conflict—The Fourth Turning by William Strauss and Neil Howe offers a generational theory of history. It argues that Anglo-American society moves through a recurring cycle of four "turnings," culminating in a crisis period that dismantles existing structures and sets the stage for a new order. This lens situates today’s geopolitical and social volatility within a historical rhythm—suggesting that collapse is not an aberration, but an essential phase of renewal.

Together, these works outline both a framework and a forecast. They argue that the institutions of the 20th century are not simply faltering—they are reaching their natural end. What comes next will be shaped by those with the foresight to anticipate structural collapse and the tools to operate independently of it. The essays that follow explore this convergence of macro cycles and micro sovereignty, offering perspective on a world in transition—and those poised to shape its aftermath.

    <h2>The Sovereign Individual: The Information Age and the Future of Freedom</h2>
Introduction: The Sovereign Individual (by James Dale Davidson and William Rees-Mogg) is a provocative nonfiction book first published in 1997. Its subtitle – “How to Survive and Thrive During the Collapse of the Welfare State” – signals its bold thesis. The authors argued that the coming Information Age would radically reshape society. In their view, the nation-state, with its welfare programs and taxes, would weaken under the pressure of global networks and digital technologies. In place of big governments, empowered individuals (“sovereign individuals”) and new forms of organization would emerge.
The book was written on the eve of the 21st century, at a moment when the internet was new and booming. Davidson (an investment advisor) and Rees-Mogg (a British editor and former Times of London director) had a track record: their earlier books had predicted the 1987 stock crash, the 1990s debt crises, and the fall of communism. The Sovereign Individual extended that pattern, offering sweeping forecasts about life in the 2000s and beyond. It proved especially influential among Silicon Valley and cryptocurrency circles. Tech investors like Peter Thiel and Naval Ravikant have praised it for its foresight, and Coinbase CEO Brian Armstrong called it “ahead of its time.”
Today, nearly three decades later, many readers revisit The Sovereign Individual with a mix of fascination and skepticism. Some of its themes – digital money, remote work, global capital flows – seem eerily prescient. Others (like completely stateless economies) appear overly futuristic. This essay will summarize the book’s core arguments and themes, weigh their strengths and weaknesses, and then examine how relevant those ideas are to the world of 2025. Finally, we will compare the book’s vision to other big ideas and ideologies (neoliberalism, classical liberalism, techno-libertarianism, and works like Balaji Srinivasan’s The Network State or Francis Fukuyama’s The End of History). Throughout, we aim for a balanced, clear discussion accessible to a general reader.
Core Arguments and Themes
 The cover of The Sovereign Individual (latest edition) proclaims its central message. It speaks of “surviving and thriving” amid the “collapse of the welfare state.” From the outset, the authors cast this collapse as inevitable, driven by technology. Here are the main ideas they develop:
·	The Fourth Stage of Society – The Information Age. The authors describe human history in broad stages. The first stage was the hunter-gatherer, then agricultural society, then the industrial era, and finally they argue the new Information Age is dawning around the year 2000. In this new stage, data and networks become the foundation of wealth, not factories or land. Knowledge workers, digital platforms, and computers replace many old industries. Just as the agricultural revolution changed life 10,000 years ago, and industry changed life 200 years ago, the information revolution will bring similarly dramatic shifts in how societies function and how people make a living.
·	The Empowered Individual (“Self-Ownership”). A core theme is radical individualism. The authors borrow from classical liberal ideas (like John Locke’s notion of “self-ownership”) but amplify them. In the Information Age, they argue, individuals will increasingly own themselves and their productive capacities. Technology allows people to move freely and work from anywhere. They call these people “sovereign individuals” – individuals who hold most of the power instead of governments. The authors predict that geographic and cultural barriers will erode. On the internet, they say, “no one who is truly able will be detained by the ill-formed opinions of others.” In cyberspace there will be “color-blind anonymity,” meaning people are judged by their skills rather than race, looks, or other identities. In this world, a brilliant but outcast person (say someone who is old, disabled, or from a disadvantaged background) can compete equally online because identity markers won’t matter.
·	Decline of Nation-States and Democracy. One of the boldest claims is that large, welfare-state governments will weaken and eventually collapse or radically shrink. How? The authors argue that technology (especially financial and data networks) will let capital and talent flow around the globe. Wealthy individuals and businesses will dodge taxes by moving money through the internet. (They famously quip that governments are like farmers milking cows, but soon “the cows will have wings.” When everyone’s wealth can “fly” to tax havens instantly, states can’t collect revenue the way they used to.) With their tax base eroded, states lose power. By 2025, according to this idea, many traditional functions of government (like pensions, universal healthcare, even policing) become much harder to finance. The welfare state, they conclude, is unsustainable in its old form.
·	In this scenario, democracy and nationhood also change. Popular majoritarian politics (taxing the rich to give to the poor, the hallmark of welfare democracy) becomes “a recipe for legalized parasitism,” as they put it, because technology makes extreme inequality likely. Instead, politics splinters: people might choose from different, more private jurisdictions (a bit like picking a service provider). Some illustrations in the book even suggest small corporate fiefdoms or city-states might replace large countries. The authors see old national loyalties fading, comparing nationalism to outdated medieval religion. They foresee a time when nationalism is seen as a backward “reaction,” and instead new forms of order (driven by efficiency and markets) take over.
·	Rise of the Cybereconomy and Digital Currency. A major prediction is that money itself will go digital. Years before cryptocurrencies were invented, they described future money as “mathematical algorithms” with no physical form. They foresee “cybermoney” issued by private markets overtaking government fiat currency. In their words, new technology will let people “bypass the national monopolies that have issued and regulated money.” Governments that traditionally print money to fund spending (“inflate and tax”) will lose that power. Only the poor, they claim, will remain at the mercy of inflation while the rich hold hard digital assets. This cyber-currency wouldn’t be counterfeitable in the way paper money is – it would be tracked and secured by cryptography. The authors describe scenarios like every transaction being on a private blockchain tied to real gold or other assets.
·	Changing Economy and Jobs. They predict a world where many traditional jobs disappear. Automation and networks create what they call a “world without jobs.” In this scenario, instead of being employees, people increasingly become consultants, contractors, or even earn income by owning a stake in automated systems (like being partial owners of a self-service shop). Essentially, technology massively boosts productivity so that a few workers can run what many once did. This could produce a huge rise in wealth for skilled people, but also large segments of society losing steady employment. The authors argue that in such a world, “earnings capacity” (what you can earn with your skills) replaces having a stable job or equal share of the pie. As a result, economic inequality widens significantly. (They controversially claim this could make democracy unworkable, since some people would do nothing while others make all the gains.)
·	Tension and Conflict – “Last Days of Politics.” As governments find themselves squeezed, the authors foresee them reacting harshly. They predict that if taxes and inflation can’t fund the state, authorities will resort to extreme measures. The book grimly suggests things like governments seizing people’s property, taking hostages, or engaging in brute force to extract money. They warn of censorship and suppression of technologies that threaten state control. In short, states turn “nasty” to defend their dwindling power. Paradoxically, this struggle could breed new kinds of conflict: private military companies, cyber-warfare, and other decentralized forms of violence. The book even draws parallels to historical periods of violent change (for example, comparing modern states to medieval institutions that fell apart).
In summary, The Sovereign Individual paints a picture of a future society where traditional political and economic structures crumble under technology, and a new order of highly autonomous individuals and networks takes their place. The welfare state and the classic nation-state are to be replaced by something entirely different – one driven by digital networks, global capital, and flexible personal sovereignty.
Strengths and Prescient Predictions
There is no doubt that many of The Sovereign Individual’s ideas anticipated real trends. Some of its most striking forecasts (at the time) have since come to pass, or at least partially. Here are a few areas where the authors were ahead of the curve:
·	Digital Currency and Blockchain: Perhaps the single prediction that draws the most attention today is their description of a private, encrypted form of money supplanting government fiat. In the early 2020s we indeed saw the emergence of cryptocurrencies like Bitcoin (launched 2009), which are algorithmic and decentralized. By 2025, hundreds of millions of people worldwide own some cryptocurrency, and a massive network of blockchains now exists. This development has surprised many because in 1997 crypto was still science fiction. The authors also described how these currencies would be hard to counterfeit and not beholden to any one government – strikingly similar to crypto ideals.
·	Mobility of Capital and Talent: The authors argued capital would become extremely mobile in the Information Age. This has proved largely true: money moves globally with ease through the internet, via electronic transfers, offshore accounts, and today via cryptocurrencies. People can invest or transact across borders in seconds. Similarly, high-skilled workers often work internationally or remotely (think of software developers in one country working for companies elsewhere). The “global network” that Davidson and Rees-Mogg envisioned has indeed formed. Ideas like digital nomadism, remote freelancing, and global online entrepreneurship have exploded. For many in technology and finance, the world is more connected and less tied to nationality than ever.
·	Internet and Cyberspace: The book foresaw that “borderless cyberspace” would empower individuals. In today’s world, it is hard to overstate how powerful the internet is. E‑commerce, social media, and the sharing economy have reshaped business and society. The dream of reaching customers anywhere in the world is very real (small businesses ship globally; anyone can sell to a global audience through online platforms). The anonymity aspect (people being judged less by personal traits) is mixed in practice, but online profiles do allow some privacy or new beginnings. Also, communities form online beyond local ties. In that sense, the authors’ vision of a vast digital frontier where individuals can interact on equal footing has materialized to a large extent.
·	Rise of Alternative Communities: The Sovereign Individual anticipated that people would increasingly gather in non-traditional communities, often around ideas or technologies. Today we see examples like online investor communities (e.g. Reddit forums deciding stock moves), open-source software communities, and various global networks of professionals. These communities sometimes influence politics or economics in ways old parties did not (the GameStop trading frenzy of 2021, or cryptocurrency “cultures” on the internet). While these are smaller-scale than nation-states, they reflect the spirit of the prediction: technology enables new kinds of collective action beyond geography.
·	Private Security and New Conflicts: The book’s warnings about conflict and private military forces have some echoes today. In recent years, private security contractors have been employed in wars (e.g. in the Middle East), and cyber-warfare between states or groups has ramped up (attacks on infrastructure or elections via hacking). While we are not yet at full “state collapse,” there is a clear trend of national borders being tested by technology (think of cyber attacks by hackers sometimes attributed to nations, or disinformation campaigns run by private groups). In finance, companies that help people manage taxes or wealth (in line with the book’s scenario of avoiding states) have grown significantly.
Overall, the strengths of The Sovereign Individual lie in how it correctly identified broad technological and economic shifts. Many foresaw that digital tech would erode some old barriers – this book took that mainstream idea further and sketched out the political consequences. Its insight that capital and information flow would become supremely important has certainly played out. Its dramatic language (about cryptographic money and “wings on cows”) captured the imagination and anticipated conversations now common among libertarian-leaning investors and technologists. In short, the authors were often thinking in the right direction about how technology changes everything.
Weaknesses and Criticisms
However, The Sovereign Individual is also deeply contested, and critics have pointed out several important weaknesses in its vision and reasoning. The book’s bold style and assumptions invite skepticism on multiple fronts:
·	Ideological Bias: The book reads less like neutral analysis and more like a libertarian manifesto. Reviewers have noted it often takes as given that governments are rapacious and individuals only care about self-interest. For example, a Kirkus Reviews critique at the time said the authors view the state “as nothing more than an entity for waging war and with a rapacious appetite for revenues.” This perspective ignores many other roles of government: infrastructure, education, healthcare, public safety, and so on. Most people value some of these services and are willing to pay taxes for them. By casting all public programs as oppressive and useless, the book skews reality. It assumes society would be fine (or better) without the cooperation and community aspects that government often provides. Critics argue this one-sided view undermines the book’s objectivity. It leaves out the social bonds and civic responsibilities that many citizens cherish.
·	Underestimating the State and Nation-Building: The authors predicted a decline of nation-states, but actual history took a different turn in many ways. For example, they did not foresee the rise of powerful tech-savvy governments. China, which was not the global superpower that it is today, has built a high-tech authoritarian state (digital surveillance, social credit systems, and even its own digital currency pilot). This is almost the opposite of the book’s anarchic picture. Many countries strengthened their ability to tax and regulate digital transactions, not abandoned it. Even democratic governments have used technology to collect taxes more efficiently and enforce laws online. Rather than some countries falling apart, we have seen new centers of power: China’s economy has grown enormous, India has become an emerging superpower, and regional unions (like the European Union) have sometimes deepened integration. The book barely accounted for the possibility that states could adapt – for example, by issuing their own digital money (central bank digital currencies, CBDCs) or by regulating the internet.
·	Technological Realities: Some of the book’s technology predictions are outdated or only partially true. While cryptocurrencies exist, by 2025 they still represent a small fraction of global transactions. The world did not universally convert to a pure “gold-backed digital ledger,” as the authors imagined. Instead, many blockchains today are unbacked tokens whose value relies on social consensus or utility (and some are highly speculative). Governments continue to issue fiat currency and control money supply. Also, the notion that everyone will transact in entirely private, permissionless networks overlooks that many people still need legal tender for daily life. The authors’ vision assumed near-perfect cryptographic solutions and mass adoption of new technology, but in reality regulators, banks, and tech limitations have kept these systems from fully replacing traditional finance.
·	Societal Values and Democracy: The book often dismisses equality and democratic ideals. It predicts democracy will “twilight” and become dysfunctional once incomes diverge. Yet as of 2025, democracy (with its flaws) remains widely supported around the world, and public debates about equity and justice are strong. Many people are not purely motivated by self-interest or profit; family, culture, and community matter. For example, the Silicon Valley tech elite loves the idea of global meritocracy, but millions of voters in democracies have repeatedly chosen leaders who promise social safety nets or economic security (from European social democracies to populist redistributors). The authors write off these democratic impulses as parasitism, but history shows people often accept some degree of shared responsibility. The rise of populist movements in recent years – which the authors partly anticipated – underscores that when inequalities grow, many citizens demand government action (health care, jobs, pensions) rather than voluntarily embracing a market-only society.
·	Overblown Predictions and Rhetoric: Some of the more lurid images in the book (governments taking hostages or becoming medieval tyrants) have not come true in any widespread way. By 2025, states have mostly avoided openly coercive behaviors like holding private citizens “to ransom” in the literal sense. True, there are pockets of authoritarian overreach (for example, mass surveillance and crackdowns), but these are often justified by governments in the name of security or health, not as a last-ditch tax scheme. The prediction that the welfare state will simply collapse has also proven too extreme. Welfare programs have been scaled back or modified in some countries, but they have not vanished everywhere – indeed many states increased welfare spending (e.g. pandemic stimulus measures, expanded healthcare). In short, history so far shows states can be more resilient or opportunistic than the book allowed.
·	Narrow Sympathy: Ethically, the book has been criticized for having little sympathy for ordinary people who might be left behind. Its heroes are the mobile, digitally-savvy capitalists. It assumes anyone who can’t keep up with technology is simply out of luck. Critics argue this is a limited, even callous, view of humanity. Society does not consist only of “star individuals” and “parasites” – most communities have a broad mix of people whose interests include care for the vulnerable, environmental concerns, etc. The Sovereign Individual largely ignores these altruistic or non-market values.
·	Scholarly Scrutiny: Unlike academic forecasts, this book mixes sweeping claims with anecdotal or rhetorical evidence. It references history in broad strokes (comparing the fall of empires or churches to modern states) but lacks rigorous data analysis in places. As one modern critic put it, it feels more like a manifesto than a detailed study. This style appeals to imagination but makes it vulnerable to factual errors. Researchers have pointed out several specific mistakes or exaggerations (for instance, some of the geopolitical analysis and timelines in the book do not match real events).
In summary, the weaknesses center on The Sovereign Individual’s strong ideological bent and its very bold extrapolations. It presents a one-sided narrative: technology is good and liberating; government is bad and oppressive. Real-world developments have been more nuanced. Empires have proved surprisingly adaptable, and technology has often strengthened state power (through surveillance and national digital projects) at least as much as it has empowered individuals. Critics advise reading the book as a visionary scenario rather than a reliable forecast, keeping in mind it shines when imagining possibilities but can overstate them when claiming inevitability.
The World Today (2025) and the Book’s Ideas
To assess how The Sovereign Individual holds up, we must consider the world of 2025. Many of the book’s themes intersect with key trends today. Below we explore how its ideas map onto recent developments in technology, money, governance, and geopolitics.
The Digital Revolution and Society
The authors’ core insight was that the digital revolution would reorder everything. This is undeniably happening: by 2025, the internet is woven into nearly all aspects of life. Over 65% of the world’s population is online, and connectivity has reached even remote areas via cheap smartphones and satellites. Cloud computing, social media, and e‑commerce dominate business and leisure. Information flows instantaneously across borders. In this sense, the Information Age they prophesied is in full swing.
In business, many traditional industries have indeed digitized. Manufacturing uses automation and robotics; retail has moved massively online (Amazon, Alibaba, etc.); entertainment is streamed globally; even agriculture benefits from data analysis (the Internet of Things). This aligns with the book’s forecast of a new “cybereconomy.” People now frequently earn income by digital means: software, online content creation, or remote professional services. The COVID-19 pandemic in 2020–2022 accelerated remote work, making the economy even more global and flexible. After 2020, companies and workers normalized video conferencing, virtual offices, and digital project tools. This is very much in line with the book’s vision that location becomes less relevant. For example, a graphic designer in India can freelance for a company in Germany as easily as a local.
Personal autonomy and anonymity have evolved in mixed ways. On one hand, the internet does allow new identities: people can assume handles in forums or form avatars in virtual reality (VR) environments. In VR and some social networks, your appearance or background might not be visible, enabling a kind of “color-blind” interaction as suggested. Some niche platforms (like the “Dark Web”) even emphasize anonymity using encryption. On the other hand, mainstream internet life is far from anonymous. Most popular services (Facebook, Google, Amazon) are built around real identities or tracking. Every click, post, and purchase is often recorded. Facial recognition, targeted ads, and data profiling mean that, in 2025, many individuals are more visible online than ever. In effect, Big Tech and some governments have created a surveillance society. This is contrary to the book’s ideal of hidden identity: in reality, personal data is a valuable commodity. So while cyberspace has expanded freedom in one sense, it has narrowed it in another by enabling new forms of control over individuals.
Artificial Intelligence (AI) is a major 2020s development the book did not explicitly predict (in 1997 AI was very primitive). Today’s AI systems – especially advanced language and image generators – have dramatically changed work and creativity. For example, automated tools can write reports, translate languages, or generate art on demand. As of 2025, this trend has begun to alter job markets: some routine white-collar tasks may be handled by AI. This resonates with the authors’ idea of “jobs without work” (though SI imagined more simple automation). However, AI has also created new jobs (AI ethicists, data scientists) that didn’t exist before. The net effect so far is mixed; AI is still emerging. Its long-term impact remains to be seen, but it is certainly in line with the book’s theme that technology will upheave traditional employment and skill sets.
In society at large, tech platforms have also influenced politics and community. Online movements can mobilize millions very quickly (witness how social media campaigns can spark real-world protests). In that sense, SI was right that decentralised networks can wield power. Yet again, these networks often get entangled with traditional politics. For instance, misinformation campaigns on social media have caused new problems for democracy, not directly foreseen by the authors.
Overall, the digital reality of 2025 confirms many general trends the book anticipated: connectivity, automation, and remote living. But it also challenges some assumptions. Far from unshackling individuals, technology has given companies and governments new tools to track and influence people. Large tech firms now sometimes have budgets and reach comparable to mid-sized nations. This concentration of power is not the free, leaderless cyber-utopia the book imagined. It suggests that while technology can diminish certain limits (on communication and commerce), it also creates new kinds of limits.
Cryptocurrency and Digital Money
One of the strongest parallels between SI and today is cryptocurrency. By 2025, Bitcoin, Ethereum, and thousands of altcoins exist and are known by a large segment of the population. At its peak, Bitcoin’s market cap reached over a trillion dollars. Surveys indicate that hundreds of millions of people have experimented with crypto assets, especially in countries with unstable fiat currencies (like parts of Latin America, Africa, or Asia). For instance, adoption rates are high in places like Vietnam, India, and Nigeria, where citizens use crypto to hedge inflation or send remittances cheaply.
This growth is the closest thing to the “digital money” the authors foretold. Cryptocurrencies are privately created and exist only as data on networks. They operate outside traditional banks and aren’t controlled by any one government. In 2024, Visa and Mastercard even announced direct support for some stablecoins and crypto payments, signaling that digital money has arrived in the mainstream. Companies like Tesla and PayPal have dipped into accepting Bitcoin, though often briefly.
However, there are important caveats: contrary to the grand vision of The Sovereign Individual, cryptocurrencies have not fully replaced fiat currency or made governments helpless. Most daily transactions worldwide are still done in government-issued money (dollars, euros, yen, etc.). The total value of global crypto transactions, while large (tens or hundreds of billions daily), remains a small fraction of global commerce (roughly 1–2% of foreign exchange volume at times). In other words, crypto is significant but still niche for now. Many businesses do not accept Bitcoin; people often convert crypto back to cash to spend it.
Governments have responded in various ways, too. Instead of completely losing monetary control, many states are adopting technology themselves. China has launched a digital yuan pilot that is a state-backed digital currency. The EU and US are seriously studying central bank digital currencies (CBDCs) as well. These could, ironically, reinforce government currencies rather than allow private ones to dominate. Regulators worldwide have also been cracking down on crypto exchanges and requiring KYC (know-your-customer) rules. This is far from the “wild west” scenario the book imagined, where crypto flows tax-free. In reality, many crypto transactions now go through regulated exchanges, and authorities like the IRS (in the US) have increased surveillance of crypto holdings.
Another difference is how crypto is used. The Sovereign Individual suggested future money would often be backed by assets like gold and that most transactions would happen on secure private ledgers. In practice, today’s crypto (especially Bitcoin) is backed by social consensus and math (proof-of-work or proof-of-stake), not actual gold or goods. It’s valuable only because people agree it’s scarce and use it as digital gold. This is a new form of “fiat” itself: Bitcoin is effectively a social convention rather than tied to any physical asset. Moreover, crypto technology has spawned new financial products (DeFi, NFTs, smart contracts) that the book did not envision. These innovations show that digital money evolved in surprising directions.
In summary, the rise of cryptocurrency is a major validation of SI’s foresight: the authors were right that money would be transformed by the internet. But the details turned out differently. The world of 2025 is hybrid: states still issue currency, but digital alternatives exist alongside. The power of blockchain is real, but it exists in a contested space shaped by both market enthusiasm and government intervention.
Global Governance and Institutions
The authors predicted a chaotic breakup of international order as states weaken. By 2025, the reality is mixed. On one hand, traditional global institutions like the United Nations, World Health Organization, and International Monetary Fund are very much active. In fact, in September 2024 world leaders met at the UN’s “Summit of the Future” and adopted a Pact for the Future, including a Global Digital Compact. This is essentially an agreement to cooperate on steering the digital age (covering AI ethics, data rights, etc.). Such cooperation suggests governments are not disappearing; they still try to solve shared problems by working together. Climate change is another area: 2025 saw new climate accords (post-Paris) aiming to curb emissions. These efforts reflect the continuing importance of nation-states and multilateralism, at least in theory.
At the same time, the spirit of nationalism and fragmentation that SI anticipated has certainly re-emerged in some places. The 2010s and 2020s saw a wave of nationalist and populist movements (Brexit in the UK, Trump in the US, right-wing parties in Europe) that often opposed globalization and supranational governance. While these movements typically called for stronger national borders (contrary to the book’s hope that nationalism fades), they do reflect a backlash against global elites – a dynamic SI described (albeit the book treated such nationalism as irrational “Luddite” reaction).
We also see tension over “internet sovereignty.” For example, China and Russia insist on controlling the internet within their borders (the “Great Firewall” of China is a prime example). They reject the vision of a single borderless cyberspace. The EU, for its part, has imposed strict data protection laws (GDPR) and is moving to regulate social media and AI – which is a way of reasserting national/regional control in the digital domain. So ironically, many countries are using digital tools to reinforce their power, not diminish it.
Trade-wise, globalization continues, but with adjustments. Some supply chains have shifted (e.g. onshoring or nearshoring due to security concerns), and regional trade agreements (like the CPTPP in Asia-Pacific) have been negotiated. The world remains interconnected economically, but states are increasingly aware of vulnerabilities (as seen during pandemic disruptions of global supply).
In short, the international order of 2025 is neither a smooth extension of old regimes nor a Hobbesian free-for-all. Instead, we have a mix of cooperation and competition: countries still band together to tackle big issues like pandemics and climate change, but they also jockey for advantage in tech (AI and quantum computing races) and trade. The prediction that nation-states would become completely irrelevant has not occurred; instead, new layers of governance (national tech policies, digital compacts) are emerging.
Geopolitical Power Shifts
Finally, how has global power redistributed? SI foresaw a decline in the Cold-War dualism and a move to a more chaotic multipolar world. By 2025, some of that is true: the unipolar moment of the 1990s (American dominance) has given way to increasing rivalry. China is now the second-largest economy and has flexed military muscle in the South China Sea and Taiwan Strait. In Eastern Europe, Russia’s aggressive war against Ukraine (beginning in 2022) has reshaped alliances and shown that old-style warfare is still very much possible. Meanwhile, the U.S. has pivoted partly to Asia and is less inclined to directly intervene in every conflict.
The book did not predict specific actors like these, but its general idea – that new powers would emerge and contests would intensify – holds true. India, for instance, has become a rising power with significant tech and military capacity. Regional groupings (ASEAN, the African Union, MERCOSUR, etc.) also claim to have more influence now than two decades ago.
On the economic front, globalization continues but with geo-economic divisions. The U.S. and China compete over technology (for example, Chinese companies like Huawei were blocked from many markets). We see a digital “arms race” (5G networks, AI leadership) reminiscent of Cold War competition, yet the confrontation is highly technological. In energy and climate, there is a tug-of-war between developed and developing nations.
Crucially, despite these shifts, no large nation has completely collapsed or dissolved. Germany, Japan, India, and others are still cohesive states. Russia remains united albeit isolated by sanctions. The European Union has weathered internal challenges (like debates over sovereignty vs unity) but still stands as a political entity. The breakdown of states that SI imagined (outside of a few cases like failed states) has largely not happened.
Another interesting dimension: the power of non-state actors. In the past decade, entities like multinational corporations and international NGOs have some powers that rival small countries. Companies such as Amazon or Google influence economies and culture globally. This matches the SI idea that not only individuals but also new kinds of organizations will reshape sovereignty. However, these companies still typically operate within national jurisdictions (they pay taxes, follow laws, etc.), so they do not supplant states.
In sum: The geopolitical picture of 2025 is complex. There is undeniable tech-driven change and a waning of the simple order that existed in 1997. But the fundamental players (strong countries, alliances, international bodies) are still very much at the center of world affairs. The radical scenario of a fully atomized, stateless world has not materialized. Instead, power has adjusted: some old powers have weakened, new ones have risen, and new institutions (often digital or hybrid) have cropped up. The Sovereign Individual captures some of these shifts at a high level, but reality shows many points of continuity as well as change.
Comparing The Sovereign Individual to Other Ideas
The Sovereign Individual can be seen in relation to various political and economic philosophies. Here we compare its core vision with other major frameworks and works:
Neoliberalism and Classical Liberalism
Neoliberalism is an economic and political ideology that became influential in the late 20th century (e.g. under Reagan and Thatcher). It emphasizes free markets, globalization, and minimal state interference in the economy. In broad strokes, SI shares neoliberalism’s faith in markets and technology. Both see globalization as unstoppable and assume that less regulation spurs innovation. However, SI goes much farther than mainstream neoliberalism in undermining the state. Most neoliberals still consider a role for government: enforcing contracts, providing basic services, and ensuring fair competition. The Sovereign Individual, by contrast, envisions the state nearly vanishing or having only a very weak presence.
Classical liberalism (19th-century ideas from thinkers like Adam Smith, John Stuart Mill, or John Locke) also valued individual liberty and limited government. SI is a radical modern descendant of that tradition. Like Adam Smith who believed the “invisible hand” of the market guides prosperity, SI authors believe technology’s “invisible hand” will rearrange society for the better (at least for capable individuals). The main difference is that classical liberals generally still trusted a constitutional state and believed in some equal rights or moral duties. SI’s outlook is more utilitarian and survivalist: it largely abandons the notion of redistributing resources or providing a social safety net, which even 19th-century liberals accepted to a degree.
In summary, The Sovereign Individual builds on the neoliberal/classical liberal lineage but adds a heavy techno-libertarian twist. It asks: what if government were almost entirely rendered obsolete by digital technology? Neoliberals might agree tech changes economics, but most would disagree with SI’s forecast that states become nearly irrelevant.
Techno-Libertarianism and Cyber-Utopianism
SI is often classified under techno-libertarianism or cyber-libertarianism, a modern strain of libertarian thought popular in tech circles. Like other cyber-utopians, the authors believe technology inherently expands freedom and should face minimal regulation. They echo ideas from the 1990s “cypherpunk” movement (Aldous Huxley-influenced, crypto enthusiasts, etc.), which advocated encryption for privacy and financial autonomy.
A key peer to SI is novels like Neal Stephenson’s Snow Crash or Cryptonomicon, which imagine anarchic futures enabled by networks and crypto. SI can feel almost like a nonfiction counterpart to these fictional worlds. Indeed, SI explicitly cites and builds on many such ideas.
However, SI differs from many techno-utopians in its tone. Some view the internet as a space where new forms of collective action (even progressive) can flourish; SI largely dismisses collective ideals. It focuses intensely on the elite or innovative as heroes. Despite this, SI has become a foundational text for Silicon Valley libertarians. It aligns with figures like Peter Thiel who speak of escaping traditional political structures (“escape velocity” in Thiel’s phrase). It also resonates with proponents of seasteading (building private island communities) or crypto-based governments.
That said, by 2025 we see some contradictions in this crowd. Many tech libertarians advocate minimal government but often benefit from existing systems (e.g. startup founders getting venture capital, initial public offerings regulated by states). As one critic has noted, some SI fans have ironically funded nationalist political movements or centralized data companies – actions that run counter to the book’s philosophy. This tension highlights that real-world technology moguls don’t always live up to the pure anti-state doctrine in SI.
The Network State by Balaji Srinivasan
Balaji Srinivasan’s The Network State (2022) is a recent book that advances a vision of how the internet can create new kinds of social organization. There are clear overlaps with The Sovereign Individual. Both authors see technology enabling people to gather in voluntary networks that could challenge the primacy of existing countries. Balaji goes further by outlining a plan: he suggests like-minded people use social media to form a digital community, then raise funds via cryptocurrency, then eventually buy land and establish a new “country” of sorts. The goal is to build a modern version of a nation-state, starting in cyberspace.
Balaji explicitly cites The Sovereign Individual several times. He shares its optimism about crypto and its skepticism of bureaucratic politics. The term “network state” even echoes SI’s idea that social connections can transcend geography. However, there are differences. SI mostly describes the breakup of old states; Balaji offers a blueprint to create new states. Balaji is more of a builder and strategist, whereas SI is more a forecaster and critic.
In practice, The Network State concept remains speculative (no complete digital nation has actually materialized). But it has captured the imagination of the same techno-libertarian community that embraces SI. Both works spark debate about whether people will continue trying to change existing countries, or simply opt out and form new communities.
The End of History by Francis Fukuyama
Fukuyama’s The End of History and the Last Man (1992) is almost the intellectual foil to The Sovereign Individual. Fukuyama argued that liberal democracy and market capitalism had triumphed globally, marking an “end” to ideological evolution. In 1992, this optimism made sense: the Cold War was over, and democracy seemed ascendant. Fukuyama suggested that after the 20th century’s turmoil, major conflicts over government forms were largely settled.
The Sovereign Individual, published a few years later, takes a radically different view. Where Fukuyama saw convergence towards liberal democracies, Davidson and Rees-Mogg foresaw fragmentation and the next great upheaval. Essentially, Fukuyama said “history is stable,” while SI said “history is just beginning a new explosive chapter.”
In hindsight (as of 2025), both authors had it only partially right. The late 1990s and 2000s did see a spread of democracy, as Fukuyama predicted – countries in Eastern Europe, Latin America, and parts of Asia transitioned away from authoritarian rule. But in the 2010s and 2020s, many of those gains have been challenged. Today’s world is arguably less settled than Fukuyama assumed. Meanwhile, SI’s more dramatic collapse of states has not (yet) occurred either. The truth may lie somewhere in between: technology has certainly shaken up the old order (as SI said), but it has not fully replaced representative governments or ended ideological struggles.
Thus, comparing SI and End of History highlights two visions: one of a gentle, final convergence to democracy (Fukuyama) and one of a sudden, cataclysmic shift to something new (SI). The reality of 2025 shows elements of both – globalization and democracy remain strong factors, but new conflicts (digital, cultural, and economic) keep history very much alive.
Conclusion
The Sovereign Individual remains a fascinating and divisive work. Its core argument – that digital technology will dissolve old political and economic structures – has proven at least partially correct. As we have seen, many trends of the last decade reflect the book’s foresight: global connectivity, the rise of cryptocurrencies, the gig economy, and the shifting balance of power. The notion of empowered individuals in a “cybereconomy” has resonance in our era of startups and social media influencers.
At the same time, The Sovereign Individual’s most radical forecasts have not (yet) come to pass. Nation-states and social democracies have shown resilience, often adapting by adopting technology themselves. Democracy, equality, and public institutions still matter to most people in 2025. Technology has also created new dependencies (for example on global social media platforms) that the authors did not envision.
In assessing the book, it helps to see it as a thought experiment – an influential manifesto of techno-libertarianism. Its strengths lie in challenging conventional thinking and inspiring readers to consider dramatic possibilities. Its weaknesses lie in underestimating complexity and nuance in society. Both supporters and critics agree it is bold: it paints an alternate future with such confidence that it forces us to ask, “Could this really happen?” Whether one views its vision as likely, partially plausible, or largely fanciful, it continues to shape debates.
Looking forward, the relevance of The Sovereign Individual will depend on how the coming years unfold. If technology continues to weaken traditional borders – say, with virtual reality communities or blockchain-based governance – then SI’s ideas will feel prophetic. If governments find new ways to harness technology for collective goals, the book’s darker predictions may recede. Either way, it will remain a touchstone for discussions about freedom, power, and identity in the digital age.
In the end, The Sovereign Individual is best read as a provocative guide to possibilities, not as a definitive blueprint. It certainly pushes us to think about who holds power in a world of rapid change – the answer may be individuals, companies, or states, or some new combination. As of 2025, all of these actors are still very much in the game. The debate the book started is far from over.

    <h2>The Fourth Turning: Generational Cycles and Modern Crises</h2>
Introduction
History often feels like it moves in spirals or cycles. One influential version of this idea comes from William Strauss and Neil Howe, who in the 1990s proposed that Anglo-American history turns in an 80–90 year cycle (a saeculum). In their model, each cycle is divided into four “turnings” or seasons: a High, a Awakening, an Unraveling, and finally a Crisis (the so-called Fourth Turning). In a High society is confident and cohesive; in an Awakening people rebel and seek spiritual renewal; in an Unraveling social order falls apart amid rampant individualism; and in a Crisis the nation must come together to rebuild its institutions. Strauss and Howe argue that each turning is led by a different generational “archetype” whose attitudes were shaped by growing up in the previous era. Together, these patterns form a grand narrative in which history’s “seasons” repeat roughly every human lifespan.
In The Fourth Turning (1997) the authors applied this framework to American history. They identified past crises roughly a century apart – the Revolutionary era, the Civil War, the Great Depression/World War II – and they predicted that the next great Crisis would arrive in the early 21st century. (As a side note, they even coined the term “Millennials” for the generation coming of age around 2000.) This bold prophecy has struck a chord in recent years. The financial crash of 2008, rising political polarization, and the coronavirus pandemic have prompted some to say that “the turning” is happening now. On social media, The Fourth Turning is quoted like a prophecy of our times, and it has inspired books, blogs, and even a stage play. At the same time, many historians and commentators warn that the theory is overly broad and unscientific – essentially a memorable myth, not a testable model.
In this essay we will explain the core ideas of Strauss and Howe’s theory – how the four turnings and four generational archetypes are defined – and then weigh those claims against evidence and alternative viewpoints. We will consider how well the theory fits real events, and whether the current American moment really looks like the climactic “Crisis” they envisioned. Finally, we will compare the Fourth Turning’s cycle-of-history view with other schools of thought – from Marx’s class-based approach, to Spengler’s civilizational cycles, to modern “cliodynamics” – to see what common ground or conflicts emerge. By the end, readers should have a clear sense of what Strauss and Howe got right or wrong, and whether thinking in generational seasons can help us understand our own age.
Generations and the Saeculum
Strauss and Howe’s theory is built on the idea that generations – the cohorts born around the same time – shape and are shaped by history. This notion goes back to thinkers like Karl Mannheim, who said a generation is defined by shared formative events, and by ancient practices (even in Homer’s Iliad warriors proudly list their ancestry). Strauss and Howe took this further: they described history as a repeating saeculum (Latin for “generation” or “century”) of roughly 80–90 years, which is roughly a long human life or a cultural lifetime. Each saeculum contains four turnings, each about 20–25 years long, that always occur in the same order.
In Strauss and Howe’s metaphor, history unfolds like four seasons of the year. One season is the High – a sunny period after a crisis when institutions are strong and society is confident (think of the optimistic post–World War II era in the 1950s). Next comes an Awakening, an age of spiritual or cultural renewal when people rebel against the old order (for example, the “Awakening” of the 1960s and 1970s in the U.S.). Then the cycle moves into an Unraveling, much like an autumn of decline: institutions weaken, public trust erodes, and individualism runs rampant (akin to the cynical 1980s and 1990s). Finally, the Crisis arrives – the wintry climax of the cycle, a great upheaval or war that forces society to rebuild (such as the collective effort of World War II, or the transformative Reconstruction era).
Each turning has a characteristic mood. In a High, people tend to feel optimistic about community and institutions. During an Awakening, they value personal faith and question authority. In an Unraveling, social order crumbles as each person looks out for themselves. And in a Crisis, Americans are gripped by a survival imperative: they focus on fixing problems, strengthening institutions, and coming together (often under strong leadership) to meet the threat. In short, Strauss and Howe write that a Crisis is “an era of destruction” when the nation essentially resets itself to face dangers. After the Crisis is over, the next cycle begins with a new High and restored cohesion.
To summarize in list form, Strauss and Howe identify four turnings in each cycle:
·	High (First Turning): A period of post-crisis optimism and strong institutions. Society is harmonious, and people feel secure (analogous to a social “spring” or “summer”). Example: America in the 1950s.
·	Awakening (Second Turning): A time of spiritual revival or idealism. The young challenge the establishment and old structures are questioned (like a cultural "summer" of upheaval). Example: America’s “Awakening” of the 1960s–70s.
·	Unraveling (Third Turning): A season of growing dysfunction. Institutions weaken, social order frays, and individualism peaks (akin to an “autumn” of decay). Example: America in the 1980s–90s.
·	Crisis (Fourth Turning): A decisive era of conflict, war, or revolution. Existing institutions collapse and must be rebuilt in a new form (a true “winter” or perilous gate in history). Example: World War II era (Great Depression + WWII) or the Civil War era.
These turnings roughly repeat every generation, and each is said to last about two decades. After a Fourth Turning crisis, a new era of High begins (after World War II came the economic boom of the late 1940s and 1950s, for instance). This pattern of repeating ages – High, Awakening, Unraveling, Crisis – is what Strauss and Howe call the Saeculum cycle.
Generational Archetypes
Linked to the four turnings are four generational archetypes. The idea is that people born around the same time (a generation) tend to develop similar attitudes because of the era in which they grow up. Strauss and Howe call each archetype by a nickname (Prophet, Nomad, Hero, Artist) and describe how each generation’s characteristics play out through the four turnings. The authors stress that these are not rigid categories: individuals within any generation vary, and the boundaries between generations are fuzzy. Rather, these labels capture broad trends in how generations as groups behave.
The generational archetypes, and the eras that shape them, are:
·	Prophet (Idealist): These generations are born during a High, growing up protected and comfortable. As young adults during an Awakening, Prophets become values-driven crusaders (think of the 1960s generation’s idealism). In midlife they are focused on moral principles, and in old age they lead in a Crisis to help rebuild society. Example: Baby Boomers (born 1946–1964) are the classic Prophet archetype, known for the counterculture and later for guiding civic renewal.
·	Nomad (Reactive): Born during an Awakening, Nomads experience an under-protected, chaotic childhood. They grow up somewhat rebellious and pragmatic, often coming of age in an Unraveling. As midlife leaders in a Crisis, Nomads are tough and world-weary (they got to see society’s problems early). Example: Generation X (born ~1965–1980) fits the Nomad profile, often seen as cynical survivors from the 1980s and 1990s.
·	Hero (Civic): Heroes are born during an Unraveling. They grow up as protected and optimistic children, because society starts strengthening again just before or during their youth. When they come of age during a Crisis, Heroes are collectively focused, team-oriented, and confident. They drive the national effort to overcome the crisis. Example: The Greatest Generation/G.I. Generation (born ~1901–1924) were Heroes who fought World War II, and Strauss and Howe argue Millennials (born ~1981–2000) are the new Heroes coming of age amid our current crises.
·	Artist (Adaptive): The youngest archetype, Artists are born during a Crisis. They have childhoods in a tense, survivalist environment (think of children born during World War II). As adults during the following High, Artists are value-centered and institutionally minded (socialized by their parents’ self-sacrifice). In midlife during an Awakening they tend to be thoughtful, sensitive leaders who seek consensus. Example: The Silent Generation (born ~1925–1942) was Artists after WWII. In modern times, the post-2000 generation (sometimes called “Gen Z” or the Homeland Generation) may be considered Artists.
In summary, each generation’s “archetype” partly determines how it responds to the historical challenges of its turn. Prophets tend to be visionaries, Nomads tough realists, Heroes optimistic team-players, and Artists adaptable planners. According to Strauss and Howe, this four-part cycle of generations explains why society can swing from discipline to rebellion to decay and back again.
Strauss and Howe’s Vision of Crisis
Strauss and Howe built on this framework to make bold predictions about America’s future. In The Fourth Turning, they argued that after the Unraveling of the late 20th century (roughly the 1980s–2000s), a Crisis era would follow. They expected this Crisis to span the first couple of decades of the 21st century. In their view, the Awakening of the 1960s and the Unraveling that followed set the stage for a Millennial generation (Heroes) to come of age in a great upheaval. Indeed, they explicitly suggested that American society was approaching a “perilous gate in history” and that Millennials would need to “upend” the Baby Boomer order much as revolutionaries had in the past.
The authors gave some examples of events that might trigger or define this next Crisis – echoing past examples (for instance, they saw Abraham Lincoln’s election as the spark of the Civil War). In broad strokes, they believed the crisis would demand a concerted mobilization of the nation. Society would pull together, possibly under a charismatic leader, to win a decisive victory over a profound threat (domestic or foreign). They even painted a dramatic picture: one commentator noted that Howe later warned of a “total war” or even civil conflict if the Crisis fully came to pass. In any case, Strauss and Howe predicted that after this coming storm, American society would emerge renewed. A new High would begin in the mid-21st century, with strengthened institutions and a fresh sense of unity.
Put simply, Strauss and Howe saw crisis as the dramatic turning point in history. They wrote that in such times, “old institutions die off along with the generations that created them,” leaving a vacuum that must be filled. This destructive phase, the Fourth Turning, was a necessary reset. Each past Fourth Turning (1770s, 1860s, 1930s–40s) was followed by a rebuild of society’s bonds and purpose. The theory implies we should expect something similar: great danger and upheaval now, but ultimately a rebirth of a stronger order. Whether one finds that encouraging or alarming depends on perspective.
Criticisms and Praise of the Theory
Strauss and Howe’s cyclical model has been both influential and controversial. Some readers find it a compelling way to understand long-term history, while many scholars criticize it as unscientific or overly speculative. It is worth considering both sides.
Strengths and Attractions: The Fourth Turning resonates with people because it organizes history into a simple, memorable pattern. It reminds us that history may not be purely random or linear – large events sometimes seem to come in waves. Notably, former Vice President Al Gore (who once studied with Strauss at Harvard) praised their earlier book Generations as a stimulating view of history. The theory has also influenced business and marketing: companies use generational archetypes to predict consumer behavior. Supporters say the book correctly anticipated at least some trends: the burst of crises in the 2000s–2020s (recession, terrorism, pandemic, political unrest) follow roughly the timetable the authors envisioned. A historian recently wrote that “events have now confirmed their predictions,” and that America is indeed facing the climax of a systemic Crisis. Fans appreciate the optimism implicit in the theory too: it holds that even the worst times can lead to renewal if society works together.
Common Critiques: Nevertheless, many scholars dismiss the Fourth Turning as more pseudo-history than robust theory. For one, the authors were not professional historians or social scientists (Strauss was a playwright; Howe a consultant), and their method relies on broad storytelling more than rigorous data. As one critic put it, the pattern is drawn to fit the history rather than emerging from it. The theory is accused of cherry-picking historical examples and fudging dates: for instance, not every crisis fits neatly into an 80-year rhythm. Detractors also say generational categories are arbitrary: people born in different years can have very different lives, and many divisions (like class or race) can be more important than birth year. Sociologists note that people often change beliefs over a lifetime, so it is dubious to claim a generation keeps fixed attitudes permanently.
Also, by focusing on generations, the theory tends to downplay other forces such as economics or class conflict. Critics say it reduces complex events to simplistic cycles. Some historians have even called the Fourth Turning an “elaborate horoscope” – vivid and alluring but unfalsifiable. (A leading cliodynamics scholar described it as “not a scientific theory… more akin to a prophecy,” since it fits history into a mold rather than predicting testable outcomes.) In short, many experts view it as fanciful pop history. Yet the authors themselves argued that one should judge such patterns by the hindsight of real history: in their view, it “resurrects a Roman term for history” to show something true about human societies.
In practice, it may be best to view the Fourth Turning as a grand metaphor. It highlights useful ideas: that generations shape history, and that societies periodically face deep challenges. But it also makes very precise claims (“a crisis every 80 years!”) that reality does not cleanly uphold. Readers should be cautious about treating it as prophecy. Instead, it can be seen as a thought-provoking lens – with some real insight about social moods, but also serious limitations.
The Fourth Turning Today: Signs of Crisis
If we take Strauss and Howe’s timeline seriously, the United States should already be in or approaching its prophesied Crisis. In recent decades, public discourse has indeed been full of drama, and many events have felt historic. The Great Recession of 2008 and the financial chaos that followed seemed, at least on the Fourth Turning clock, like the “trigger event” that began the era of upheaval. The years since then have seen profound developments: chronic political polarization, loss of faith in institutions, and intense culture-war conflicts. Massive presidential elections (2016, 2020) brought bitter divisions, reminiscent of past crises around disputed votes. Nationwide protests and civil unrest (on issues from racial justice to political legitimacy) swept the country, showing how frayed social bonds have become.
In 2020–2021, the coronavirus pandemic shocked society on multiple levels, touching off economic hardship, debates over public health and personal liberty, and again a sense of emergency. At the same time, climate disasters and global security crises (like wars and geopolitical tensions) have compounded the feeling of global crisis. These trends fit the Fourth Turning narrative: they are the “storms” that test a nation’s cohesion and set the stage for fundamental change.
Strauss and Howe would say this is exactly the point: such traumatic events push a society to break with the past. Analysts who follow the Fourth Turning often point out that many “Prospectors of Crisis” predicted something like this. For example, the rise of strong, populist leaders (nationalist or otherwise) looks like the hero generation stepping up, much as FDR or Lincoln did. Some fans of the theory even note a telling meme of our times: “Hard times create strong men; strong men create good times; good times create weak men; weak men create hard times.” In other words, generations that mature during hardship become strong, but their success leads to decadence in the next era, which then sows the seeds of new hardship. This folk wisdom echoes what Strauss and Howe formalized.
Of course, skeptics counter that every era can find dire problems — but not every era produces a true societal rebirth. While many Americans feel a sense of crisis today, it has yet to match the scale of Civil War or World War II. It’s debatable how much unity we can actually muster. Nevertheless, to evaluate the theory’s relevance, we look for signs: Do we see institutions cracking and new ideas springing up? Is a generational “hero” cohort like the Millennials rising to the occasion? Are Baby Boomers (the prophet generation) clinging to power? Enthusiasts argue yes: Millennials increasingly hold public office and push big agendas on technology, economy, and culture; meanwhile many Boomers and Gen Xers are entrenched in existing institutions, often at odds with the younger vision. If the Fourth Turning is happening, we should expect the old order to be swept away and a new consensus to form, possibly by the mid-2020s. Only time will tell if that comes true.
Regardless of belief, the theory has become a common shorthand for understanding late 2010s and early 2020s America. Observers have pointed out parallels like: 1929 crash/2008 crash, World War II/potential future war, New Deal/modern government programs, as if history is rhyming. It is also noteworthy that Strauss and Howe’s more recent writings (for example The Fourth Turning Is Here, 2023) have embraced the idea that America is in the final, most perilous phase of the cycle. This has kept the theory in public view and sparked lively debate about our political moment.
Comparison with Other Historical Theories
The Fourth Turning is just one way of viewing history. To understand its place, it helps to compare it with other grand narratives of societal change.
Marxist Historical Materialism
Karl Marx’s view of history is famously different. For Marx, the engine of history is class conflict driven by economic forces. Society moves from feudalism to capitalism to, ultimately, communism, as the proletariat overthrow the bourgeoisie. Marx did see crises – economic depressions and revolutions – but these were class struggles, not generational shifts. The ending of Marx’s cycle is not a return to another old age; it is a transition to a classless society.
Comparing Marx and Strauss-Howe: Marx emphasizes material conditions (factories, capital, class) and predicts a linear progress (ending in utopia). Strauss-Howe emphasize social moods and culture, with history as a repeating loop. In Marxism, generational age is not central at all; people change roles as classes. In the Fourth Turning theory, generational identity is the key variable, while class, race, or gender are backgrounded. Critics of the Fourth Turning often argue it ignores the economic issues central to Marx. On the other hand, the Fourth Turning might be critiqued by Marxists for not addressing how inequality and exploitation drive change.
Where the theories intersect is in seeing something cyclic. Marx did write about capitalism’s cycles of boom and bust, but saw them accelerating toward revolution, not repeating patterns with rejuvenation of capitalism. So overall: Marxism offers a more deterministic, economics-driven cycle (capitalism collapses, socialism rises once), while Strauss and Howe offer a cultural-generation cycle that keeps repeating. These are radically different lenses.
Spengler’s Decline of the West
Oswald Spengler, in the early 20th century, proposed a grand civilizational cycle in The Decline of the West. He argued that great cultures (like Egyptian, Chinese, or Western) follow a life-cycle of growth and decay, akin to organisms living about a millennium. By Spengler’s telling, Western Civilization was entering its final “Winter” stage around the 21st century. Like Strauss and Howe, Spengler saw history in vast, repetitive patterns. But his cycle is much longer (centuries, not decades), and it covers the fate of whole civilizations, not shifting generations.
Compared to the Fourth Turning: Spengler’s view is broader and more fatalistic. He focuses on culture, art, and the inevitable “sunset” of a civilization. Strauss and Howe, by contrast, focus on society’s civic institutions and assume that nations can regenerate after a crisis. Spengler would argue the West is in irreversible decline; Strauss and Howe would say we’re on the eve of renewal. The Fourth Turning is specific to Anglo-American history (though they hint at parallels elsewhere), while Spengler’s template was global. Also, Spengler did not emphasize generational psychology – he wrote before such demographic concepts were popular.
An interesting point of comparison is that both theories share a cyclical intuition, but Spengler is long-term and culture-centric, whereas the Fourth Turning is shorter-cycle and Americans often interpret it in terms of national destiny. Critics of Fourth Turning sometimes note that unlike Spengler, Strauss and Howe do allow for positive rebirth. But both attract attention for their sweeping scope.
Cliodynamics and Secular Cycles
In modern times, cliodynamics has emerged as a field using mathematics and data to find patterns in history. Figures like Peter Turchin study "secular cycles" of societies, often spanning 200-300 years. For example, Turchin has identified long cycles in population, state strength, and social unrest: a period of integrative growth followed by de-integrative crisis (similar to prosperity then trouble). He analyzes actual historical data (birth rates, wars, economy) to build models.
While cliodynamics also sees repeating crises, its approach is quite different from Strauss and Howe. Cliodynamical cycles are often linked to population pressure, elite overproduction, or resource limits, rather than generational attitudes. Turchin’s model might predict a crisis when inequality becomes extreme and the state cannot satisfy the elite. It is more quantitatively driven and is grounded in empirical records.
Some cliodynamicists are explicitly critical of the Fourth Turning’s approach. For instance, Turchin has called it “pseudoscience” because it fits history to a convenient cycle without rigorous tests. Cliodynamics asks, does the timing and cause of crises follow statistically measurable factors? The Fourth Turning asks, does a mood cycle repeat roughly every human life? In practice, the cliodynamics view of the modern era would note increasing unrest and predict a possible crisis, but it wouldn’t necessarily tie this to specific birth-year cohorts or cultural archetypes.
In short, cliodynamics and the Fourth Turning both see cycles, but disagree on what drives them (demography and class vs. generations and values) and on methodology (data modeling vs. narrative analogy).
Other Perspectives
There are other related ideas in history. For instance, the 50-year Kondratieff waves suggest economic cycles of boom and bust (though these are economic patterns, not generational). Philosophers like Hegel talked about dialectic periods of thesis-antithesis-synthesis, but not in fixed intervals. Alexis de Tocqueville and others saw pendulum swings between liberty and equality at long timescales.
Overall, many historians agree that recurring patterns exist – societies do experience eras of energy and stagnation – but they differ on whether these are exact cycles or looser rhythms. Marxists would warn not to overlook class; Spenglerians would warn not to overrate Western exceptionalism; cliodynamicists would insist on evidence. The Fourth Turning is one imaginative pattern among these theories.
Conclusion
Strauss and Howe’s The Fourth Turning is a fascinating attempt to find order in the sweep of history. Its appeal lies in its simplicity and drama: history as four seasons that repeat, with each generation playing a part in an epic story. For a general reader, the idea can feel intuitive – after all, the phrase “what goes around comes around” captures a similar instinct. The theory points out that crises like wars and revolutions do happen repeatedly, and it encourages us to learn lessons from them.
However, a critical look shows limits. Societies today are vastly more complex and interconnected than in the past. Not every pattern will repeat with precision, and many factors (technology, economics, culture) influence events beyond generational mood. Some of the book’s specifics – the exact timing, the archetypes of each generation, even who counts as which generation – can seem arbitrary. Critics remind us that millions of Americans did not fit neatly into Boomers, Gen Xers, or Millennials, and that economic class or race might matter more.
Yet, the value in The Fourth Turning may not be literal prediction. Its worth may lie in prompting us to think long-term and to pay attention to the changing attitudes of each generation. It serves as a narrative framework, not a clockwork mechanism. If nothing else, it underscores that our society does go through phases: periods of cohesion and crisis, periods of questioning authority and then of rebuilding it.
In our current time, it is natural to wonder whether we are living through the next “Fourth Turning.” Whether or not Strauss and Howe’s calendar proves accurate, asking that question makes us more aware of historical parallels. We can ask ourselves: If this is a crisis era, what institutions are under threat? What new values are emerging? Will today’s “heroes” live up to the challenges?
Ultimately, history is shaped by what people do more than what patterns predict. Strauss and Howe remind us that older Americans will pass on, younger Americans will take charge, and their different outlooks will steer the ship. By combining this insight with a dose of skepticism, readers can use the Fourth Turning as a lens – but not an oracle – for understanding the times. The only sure thing is that generations will continue to churn, and each cycle will have its share of turmoil and triumph. The real question is how we navigate them.
